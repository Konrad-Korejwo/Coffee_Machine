# Coffee_Machine
One of my first projects in Python - Coffee Machine simulator. This is only backend of this machine - we have no mechanical influence.

Release v1.0:
In that program you can chose your coffee. The program will check if there is enough ingredients to make it.
There are 3 types of coffee - espresso, latte and cappuccino. Each of it has different price and uses different amount of milk, water and coffee.
When you "put" money, you will receive the change so don't worry - you can buy a coffee using 100$ bill and higher :)

Release v1.1:
You can reset magazine and money to the start settings.
